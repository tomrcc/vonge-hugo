## Develop

To run locally:
```bash
hugo serve
```

To generate the component browser:
```bash
npm run bookshop-browser
```
This will create browser files in the site's static directory. Running a Hugo build after this will show a live component browser at `/components` 

If there is a bookshop error when running locally, try updating bookshop:
```bash
npx @bookshop/up@latest
```

## Structure
The bookshop components live in `component-library`, which is loaded as a Hugo module in `site/config.toml`.

The site also pulls in the main dependency of `github.com/cloudcannon/bookshop/hugo/v3`.

For further help with Bookshop, see the [Bookshop Guides](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop).
